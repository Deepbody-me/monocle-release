\description{
Recently Alex Wolf and colleague first proposed the idea to represent the data with an "abstract partition graph"
of clusters identified by Louvain clustering by simply connecting significantly overlapping Louvain clusters (Wolf et al. 2017). 
Similar methods for "abstract partition graph" are also recently developed and applied in analyzing the zebrafish / frog cell 
atlas datasets (Wagner et al. 2018; Briggs et al. 2018). This coarse-graining representation of the data address a few limitations 
of tree-based trajectory inference algorithms, for example, the default principal tree learning algorithm (DDRTree) in Monocle 2. 
Although the particion graph doesn't learn an explicit simplified principal tree as DDRTree in Monocle 2, it can naturally separate 
outlier cell groups and potentially also parallel trajectories while DDRTree often requires pre-processing before hand to robustly 
reconstruct trajectory and cannot handle non-tree like structure. Instead of directly learn a coarse-graining graph of clusters, 
we instead take advantage of the participation graph and use it as merely a heuristic initial condition for L1-graph algorithm 
(as explained in the next section) to learn the principal points and principal graph at the same time directly from the reduced 
UMAP data space. In contrast to the cluster participation method, the principal graph learnt provides an abstraction of the data 
manifold while also preserves the local information from the original data space as it is directly embedded in the original data space. 
In Monocle 3, we use the clustering_louvain function from the igraph package to perform community detection and implemented an efficient
version of "abstract partition graph" from Alex Wolf. Basically, we first create a design matrix \eqn{X}{} representing the allocation of 
each cell to a particular louvain cluster. The column of \eqn{X}{} represents a louvain cluster while the row of \eqn{X}{} a particular cell. 
\eqn{X_{ij} = 1}{} if cell \eqn{i}{} belongs to cluster \eqn{j}{}, otherwise 0. We can further obtain the adjacency matrix \eqn{A}{} of the kNN graph 
used to perform the louvain clustering where \eqn{A_{ij} = 1}{} if cell \eqn{i}{} connects to \eqn{j}{} in the kNN graph. Then the connection 
matrix \eqn{M}{} between each cluster is calculated as, \eqn{M \cdot {X'}{A}{X}}{}. Once \eqn{M}{} is constructed, we can then follow 
Supplemental Note 3.1 from (Wolf et al. 2017) to calculate the significance of the connection between each louvain clustering and 
consider any clusters with p-value larger than 0.05 by default as not disconnected.
