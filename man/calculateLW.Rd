\title{Function to calculate the neighbors list with spatial weights for the chosen coding scheme from a cell dataset object}
\usage{
calculateLW(cds, k = 25, return_sparse_matrix = FALSE,
  interactive = FALSE, verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{The cellDataSet object where the neighbors list is calculated from}

\item{k}{The maximum number of nearest neighbors to compute}

\item{return_sparse_matrix}{A logic flag that controls whether or not to return a sparse matrix}

\item{interactive}{Whether or not to allow the user to choose a point or region in the scene, then to only identify genes spatially correlated for those selected cells.}

\item{verbose}{A logic flag that determines whether or not to print execution details}
}
\description{
This function first retrieves the association from each cell to any principal points, then builds a kNN graph for all cells
and removes edges that connected between groups that disconnected in the corresponding principal graph and
finally uses this kNN graph to calculate a global Moranâ€™s I and get the p-value
