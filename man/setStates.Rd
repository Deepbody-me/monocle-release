\title{Assign a state for each cell.}
\usage{
setStates(cds, minimal_branch_len = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{cds}{the CellDataSet upon which to perform this operation}

\item{minimal_branch_len}{the minimal length of the principal tree segment to be treated as a true branch. Default to be 10.}
}
\value{
an updated CellDataSet object, in which phenoData contains values for State and Pseudotime for each cell
}
\description{
This function first decomposes the learned principal graph for the data into separate graph components. 
It then applies depth first traversal (DFS) for each graph component sequentially and assigns each principal point 
a State number. The State number increases every time we find a node has degree larger than 2 or when we 
move to the next graph component. Thus the state assignment are more meaningful if we run learnGraph with 
DDRTree, SimplePPT (and without loop clousre by setting close_loop = T) but not with L1graph. The cells inherit
the corresponding principal points' state (pseudotime, see below) value. The first cell 
with degree equal to 2 (the first cell if there is no cells has degree equal to 2) identified is used as the 
root cell. Note that this function also assigns pseudotime by default. But the orderCells function should be 
used in order to obtain correct ordering of the developmental trajectory under study.
